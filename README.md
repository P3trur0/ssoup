SSoup - Pimped JSoup
====================

Source: http://filippodeluca.com/programming/2012/11/02/Pimping-Jsoup

---

This is a fork of SSoup by Filippo De Luca.  
It has been slightly modified by:

- updating Scala version to 2.11
- replacing Spec2 tests with ScalaTest 3.0.0
- introducing asynchronous processing of SSoup(i.e.: Scala `Future`)
